Personalization: It stores details like the user's name, home location, birthday etc. to generate personalized responses.
Tasks Execution: Based on voice commands, it can open apps, search Wikipedia & Google, play videos, get weather, news, tell jokes & stories, take screenshots, etc.
Conversation History Tracking: It records conversations to refer to context and exports logs to JSON.
Extendable: The modular structure allows easy integration of new features like adding more skills, connecting to devices etc.
In summary, it provides a voice-controlled assistant that can have natural conversations with end users to help with various tasks by leveraging AI and other automation techniques. The GUI and personalization allows delivering a more engaging user experience.Here are some of the key things it does:
